# Project1 Testing Guide

This guide walks you through the commands to test my project on your local machine.

## 1. Start the Application

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```bash

cd "your_directory"

python project1.py

uvicorn project1:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload

```

## 2. In another terminal navigate to the project directory with gradebot.exe in it:

```bash

cd "your_directory"

.\gradebot.exe project1

```

## In my testing I got a 65/65 on the gradebot

## The commands I used for the gradebot and for testing are in my testing.txt file if you want to see what I did.
